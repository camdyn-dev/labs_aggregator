# labs_aggregator
This is a project I've had in mind for a while and decided to recently work on it.

Basicailly, I have a large backlog of lab results in PDFs and thought it may be interesting to compile all that information into a CSV file with the intention of creating some charts with Seaborn.

That's what the point of this project is; it takes the specified lab results from each PDF and aggregates it into one CSV file.
